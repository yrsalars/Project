# Project
As I am not very well known with python I am not sure what is a reasonable project for this course and have provided two options, where I think the first would be more time demanding.

DESCRIPTION:

Idea 1
I work with large datasets of LC-MS data where I am currently using programs provided from the company that makes the machine. The files are containing large information where I would like to put in demands on sorting out the information that I need (finding the right molecular masses).
For this dataset I would also want to detect matches in this file with smaller datasets, where I can change the specific requirements for matches.

Idea 2
I am working with alot of non-target analysis for chemical compounds and I am currently using an online tool to search for chemical formulas that match the molecular mass. This is done by searching for each mass and getting several result. I am planning on making a script that finds approximetly 3 possible chemical formulas with ppm error lower than 50. This would be done for a file with approximatly 50 numbers of masses for each file. One additional code could also be added of matching masses with other known masses and assigning the chemical formulas from that file.
